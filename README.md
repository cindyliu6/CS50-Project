# CS50-Project

## Welcome!

Welcome to our CS50 project! Justin, Cindy and Joey are excited to share with you the work that we have done over the last couple of weeks. 

### Project overview 

Our project's objective was to use reinforcement learning to beat "The World's Hardest Game". When you open our project later, you will see that the final product has three different components. The first option is to play the game, the second option is to watch the computer train itself to play the game, and the final option is to see the computer play the game by itself.
