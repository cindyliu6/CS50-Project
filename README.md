# CS50-Project

## Welcome!

Welcome to our CS50 project! Justin, Cindy and Joey are excited to share with you the work that we have done over the last couple of weeks. 

### Project overview 

Our project's objective was to use a genetic learning algorithm to beat "The World's Hardest Game". When you open our project later, you will see that the final product has three different components. The first option is to play the game, the second option is to watch the computer train itself to play the game, and the final option is to see the computer play the game by itself. 

### Getting started 

To get started, first download the zip file onto your local computer and unzip the included files into a folder. After doing so, open the folder with either a local or cloud IDE. Before running the game, it is essential to have installed Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ , Pygame from https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted , 

### Running the Project 

Running the game is done through the file game.py. Depending on your IDE, this will be done through different methods. After you have ran this file, you will see a homescreen presenting you the options to either play the game, watch the computer train, or to see a trained copy running thie game. Use the arrow keys to navigate through the homepage and the enter key to select the option that you wish to play. If you select the option to play the game, you will progress from level to level. If you select the option to train the computer or watch a trained program run through the game, you will have the option to choose a specific level.
